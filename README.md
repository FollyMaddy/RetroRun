# RetroRun

Open RetroPie roms in standard pcmanfm filemanager with 1 click !

Program : RetroRun.sh

Version : 1.3


Use : 

RetroRun is a simple program created to run allmost all ROMS of RetroPie from your windows desktop enviroment (X).


Dependencies : 

RetroRun only works if RetroPie is installed on your computer.

RetroRun uses pcmanfm filemanager !!!


How to run :

An install script and an uninstall script is added

Discription of what these scripts do are in the scripts themselves.

Make the program executable, dubbleclick and choose open in terminal.

Or run it from the terminal with : ./install.sh

for uninstall use the file uninstall.sh


Additional tips :

The program uses the retropie directory rom directory structure, 

but the directory can also be */roms/'system'/(*/)*.* (*=can be anything)

Seems like all files can be associated with RetroRun, including zip and cue

Make sure rom files are not set as executable, otherwise some files will be detected as a script (like .cue) and then do not work!!


Issue => opening with other programs :

If zip or txt(octet) files are associated with RetroRun they will not open with other programs anymore !

So if you want them to open with another program use option : open with !!!
